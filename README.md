# Addon List for Question2Answer [![Question2Answer](http://qa-themes.com/files/q2a-logo.png)](http://www.question2answer.org/) [![Question2Answer Themes](http://qa-themes.com/files/qa-logo.jpg)](http://qa-themes.com/ "Q2A Themes & Plugins")
This is a list of all(not, still in progress) Q2A Themes, Plugins, and developers. since Q2A's current list doesn't include all addons I've created this list with to include all free and premium addons and provide better search and filtering to help administrators find what they need much easier.


## Demo
Currently a [live demo](http://addons.qa-themes.com/) is on my site.

## Contribution
You can send your edits to my contact form or edit the files here directly. pull requests are welcome.

## Fairness
All free and premium Q2A products are welcome. however the name and description should describe the features of product correctly.
Also list of Q2A Developers will be randomly shuffled in each pageload to prevent favouritism.
